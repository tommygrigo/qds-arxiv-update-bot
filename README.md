arxiv update bot is a simple python script that scraps the arXiv, search for interesting papers and sends a message on telegram if any was found.

## Note:

This repository is Tommaso Grigoletto's personal fork of the original repo [arxiv update bot](https://github.com/nanoy42/arxiv-update-bot). All the credit for the code goes to [nanoy42](https://github.com/nanoy42). 

I simply adapted the code to include the search for favorite authors and some changes in order to run the bot entirely on Github using Github actions and secrets. 

The newest update includes daily updates sent via email!
